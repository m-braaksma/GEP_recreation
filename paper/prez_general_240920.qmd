# Motivation

- We want to estimate the monetary value of recreation as an ecosystem service.
- We would like to do this credibly at a global scale to produce a country-year panel.
- This is a subcomponent of the larger GEP value for each nation and likely a sizeable value.

# Components of Recreation GEP

- Nature-based recreation can be sub-divided by the type of recreation (park, camping, beach, lake activites, eco-tourism, etc.). 
- The key distinction for nature-based recreation is that these are activities where the main attraction (or attribute deriving utility) comers from nature. 
- For our purposes, we can start by narrowing our examination to camping or hiking recreation in protected areas. But in general, we can modify the following approach to consider a wider definition of nature-based recreation.

# Previous Estimates of Recreation Value

- 

# GEP Formula

Deterministics (accounting) formula:
Panel of monetary value over year $t$ and country $c$
Requires aggreagtion to value by year and country to be consistent with system of national accounts (SNA) as presented with SEEA accounts. 

$$
GEP_{i,t} = \lambda \cdot (P_{i,t} \cdot Q_{i,t})
$$

- $\lambda$: Nature's contribution
- $P$: Price
- $Q$: Quantity

While $\lambda$ may vary over time and space, there is a theoretical and empirical decision to assert it is constant. Empirically, difficult to measure a change over time. Theoretically, if the value of recreation comes from contributions of land, labor, and capital -- is the relative contribution of land compared to labor and capital changing (meaningfully) over time? Does it vary over country (componsition of the country)? Probably linked to structural transformation (development of a country).


# Estimating Quantity $Q$

- Main issue: Not observing park vistors in systematic way across global and across time.

Propensity to Visit: likelihood function using attributes of the park that are attractive and the distance of the park to determine the number of visitors are park gets each year
- Calibrate the likelihood function with recorded measures of the number of vistors to a park (bonus if we know where they came from)
- Using info on population size for each grid cell, we can then determine the number of people visiting from from grid cell and total vistattion to each park.

# Estimating Price $P$

- Main issue: (1) do not observe prices (2) most recreation is often free access or subsidized

Willingness to Pay (WTP) through revealed preference of travel cost
- Need to use multinominal logit model on attributes of the park (particularly distance to park)
- f(e) is logisitic
- V(x,s) = travel cost (determined by distance and cost of gasoline) s.t. to incomes (proxy by average income for a gridded cell)
- g(B) = variation over distribution of heterogenous taste/attribute of visitors: domestics/international, urban/rural, income

# Estimating Nature's Contribution $\lambda$

- Something out of gtap. Alternatively, we can try to use a hedonic model on prices.

# Data Requirements

- World Protected Areas Database
    - Shapefiles for location and size of existing protected areas and when they open (allows for dyanmic component)
- InVEST Scenic Quality Model
    - https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/invest/scenic-quality
    - Determine avg (or max) attractiveness of each park 
    - Need info on viewpoints, visibility of view points (DEM), and weight for value of each view point (relative value)
- Gridded Population Data
    - \# of people in each grid cell and where they live. 
- Incomes at sub-national level
    - Assign as the average income (budget constraint) for people in given grid cells
